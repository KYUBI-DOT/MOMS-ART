          <h2>The History of Bhutanese Textiles</h2>
          <p>
            The history of Bhutanese textiles becomes more evident in the last century.
            As textile production moved beyond the confines of clothing to artistic expression of 
            individuals and communities, patronage from the royal household was vital.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the founders of the Wangchuck dynasty are from Bumthang, their ancestral home 
            is in Lhuntse District, which was historically recognised as the home of the most celebrated
            weavers in the country. The role and influence of royal women in sustaining and furthering the
            weaving tradition must be acknowledged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 10th Trongsa Penlop Jigme Namgyal built the Wangducholing Palace in 1857. The loom houses
            (thagchem), accommodating 30 to 40 weavers, were built around the same time near the palace and
            existed until the mid-1900s.

        <div class="article-text">
          <p>
            The youngest sister of the second king, Princess Ashi Kencho Wangmo Wangchuck 
            (later a Buddhist nun), is credited to have introduced the horizontal loom from Tibet in the 1930s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her Majesty the Queen Mother Ashi Sangay Choden Wangchuck continues to extend
            royal patronage to the textile industry. Her Majesty's interest and intervention have
            revitalised Bhutanese textiles, given the industry an impetus within the country, and brought
            world attention to Bhutanese craftsmanship. She is the Royal Patron of the Bhutan Textile Museum 
            and the Chairman of the Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan (RTAB).

          <p>
            Today Bhutanese textiles have reached new heights of dynamism and respect; they are valued not only 
            for their economic viability, but also as a symbol of Bhutan's artistic heritage that commands world 
            attention and appreciation.
          </p>

          <h3>Women Weavers</h3>
          <p>
            Ordinary weavers produced fabrics for general use that were of standard quality. 
            The farmers wove only when they were free from agricultural work. It was the royal weavers, 
            <em>thama</em>, in the royal loom houses who were the professionals. Some of the aristocratic and 
            landed households also had professional weavers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The all-encompassing use of textiles took it beyond the realm of clothing to the realms of rituals 
            and symbolism, as a form of wealth and commodities for trade and taxation. A well-established system
             of
            production, use and exchange linked the communities, extended the threads of interdependence, 
            and wove 
            the very fabric of Bhutanese society.
          </p>

          <h3>Types of Patterns</h3>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>Sertha:</strong> Plaid weave usually with yellow or orange as the dominant color.</li>
